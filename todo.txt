ssub: put in a check for available clusters

fix the dry run collisions and empty input problem

add a check to make sure the barcode is pointing the right way (i.e., the columns are not reversed)

map_barcodes: include an option for reverse primers?
on length checking, raise assertion error and give the line number where the problem happened

intersect: fastq_entries is in here. It should be put somewhere else, and map_barcodes and remove_primers can both refer to it.

remove_primers.py: What's with the wacky indenting?

test: make unit tests for all the utilities

make a dependency map so we can see what calls what. Is there a way to automate this?

make a project bashrc that gets called by the job in the arrays? this way the python version, etc is right

generally:
* why this error thing and not raising runtimerrors?
* put a sensible hashbang at the top? I don't like saying python whatever.py
